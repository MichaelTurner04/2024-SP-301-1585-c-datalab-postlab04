1a."./compiley.sh program.cpp hello"
1b.The code takes the two parameters following "compiley.sh" assigns them to variables "input" and "output". The program outputs each parameter then runs the compile command "g++ -o "$OUTPUT" "$INPUT""
2a.You can run the program, but the compilation will not be successful.
